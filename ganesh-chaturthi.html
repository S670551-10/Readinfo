  <h1>Ganesh Chaturthi</h1>
  <hr>
  <p><b>Ganesh Chaturthi</b>, also called <b>Vinayaka Chaturthi</b>, is a Hindu festival that celebrates the birth of Lord Ganesha, the son of Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati. Lord Ganesha is known as the remover of obstacles (Vighnaharta), the giver of wisdom, and the bringer of happiness.</p>

    <h2><li>Story of Bal Ganesh</h2>
  <p>According to Hindu mythology, once Goddess Parvati wanted to take a bath. To guard the door, she created a boy out of sandalwood paste — this boy was Bal Ganesh. She instructed him not to let anyone inside.
<br><br>
When Lord Shiva returned, Ganesh stopped him at the entrance. Shiva, not knowing who the boy was, became angry and in a fight, cut off Ganesh’s head.
<br><br>
Parvati was heartbroken and demanded her son back. To calm her, Shiva promised to bring Ganesh to life again. He asked his followers to bring the head of the first living being they saw — it was an elephant. Shiva placed the elephant’s head on the boy’s body, giving him new life. Since then, Lord Ganesha is worshipped as the elephant-headed god of wisdom and prosperity.</p>

<h2><li>History</li></h2>
<p>The worship of Ganesha is very old, but the tradition of celebrating <b>Ganesh Chaturthi</b> in public started during the time of <b>Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj</b>. Later, in 1893, <b>Lokmanya Bal Gangadhar Tilak</b> turned this festival into a big social event. He used it to bring people together and to increase unity during India’s freedom struggle.</p>

<h2><li>Duration and Rituals</li></h2>
<p>The festival begins in the Hindu month of <b>Bhadrapada (August–September)</b> on the fourth day of the bright fortnight. It usually lasts for 10 days, ending with the immersion (Visarjan) of Ganesha idols on Anant Chaturdashi.
<br><br>
At homes and in public pandals, idols of Ganesha are installed with rituals. People perform prayers, sing aartis, and offer sweets like modak, which is believed to be Ganesha’s favorite. On the last day, idols are taken in colorful processions with music and dance, and then immersed in water.
</p>
<h2><li>Cultural Importance</li></h2>
<p>Ganesh Chaturthi is not only a religious festival but also a cultural celebration. It brings people together, encourages art, music, theatre, and community activities. In Maharashtra, the festival is celebrated with special grandeur in cities like Mumbai and Pune.
</p>
<h2><li>Eco-friendly Celebration</li></h2>

<p>In recent years, there is a growing awareness about the environment. Many people now use clay idols and natural colors instead of Plaster of Paris, so that rivers and lakes remain clean after the immersion.</p>
